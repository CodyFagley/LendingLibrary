# Cody && Lisa's Lending Library
This project was inspired by Handel IT and serves a few purposes.

First, it fulfills the requirement for the interview process with Handel IT

Second, it keeps track of loaned goods

#  Functionality
It uses C# as a frontend and a Microsoft 2008 SQL Server for the backend.

When an item is loaned to family or a friend, the following is entered into a
 table:

* Primary Key
* Item Name
* Name of Loanee
* Date Loaned
* Date Returned (if returned)
* Description of the Item

#  Notes on the Project
Admittedly, this is the first time I have used Visual Studio in a few years,
 and I have never used C#, SQL or .Net prior to this.

I will be slowly adding files to the .gitignore list as soon as I know which
 files are not required by others to build the project.
